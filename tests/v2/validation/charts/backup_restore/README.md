# Backup Restore Operator (BRO)
Backup Restore Operator (BRO for short) is a disaster recovery chart that can be installed on the local cluster only, and is used to create backups of Rancher resources contained in the `rancher-resource-set`. The resource set becomes available after the chart is installed and can be edited as a user needs. Once a backup is created and stored in either a local volume or in an S3 storage location (such as AWS S3 or Minio S3), a restore operation can be created to restore Rancher back to the backed up version of the Rancher resources.

## Pre-requisites
- Downstream RKE1 and RKE2 clusters are required before running the test(s)
- All tests require configs pulled in from the broInput parameter.
